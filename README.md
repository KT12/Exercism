# Exercism

A repo for my solutions to exercises from [Exercism](http://exercism.io/), which is an online track to become a proficient programmer in various languages.  I am hoping that my solutions will help others who are also learning Python to become better programmers themselves.

This repo is organized by programming language.  Currently I am working on the Python track.  I hope to add R, Matlab, bash, Scala, Java in the future and continually learn new languages.
